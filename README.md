## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for a retro-style Snake game built with Python and Pygame. The game features classic Snake gameplay where players control a snake to eat food, grow longer, and avoid collisions with walls and the snake's own body. As part of "Source Start," an open source event organized by CSI SPIT, we invite developers, game enthusiasts, and Python learners to contribute to this project by adding new features, improving gameplay mechanics, enhancing graphics, or optimizing the code.

## Getting Started
